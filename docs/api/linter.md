Linter is a base linter provider for the hackable [Atom Editor](http://atom.io). Additionally, you need to install a specific linter for your language. You will find a full list on [atomlinter.github.io](http://atomlinter.github.io/).

It provides a top-level API to its consumer so that they can visualize errors and other types of messages with ease.
